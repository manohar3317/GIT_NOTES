Understanding Key Git Locations
In this section, we'll cover essential locations related to Git-managed content. Mastering these will provide you with a solid foundation in Git. This is an introductory overview; as you progress, your understanding will deepen.

1. Working Tree
	• Definition: The working tree is the location on your computer containing the directories and files of a single commit.
	• Purpose: Here, you can view and edit files, preparing them for the next commit.
	• Usage: Checking out a commit places its directories and files into the working tree for easy editing.
	• The Working Tree in Git refers to the folders and files from a specific commit of the project on your local system. It’s where you can view and edit files before preparing them for the next commit.
	

2. Staging Area (or Index)
	• Definition: The staging area is a list of files that will be included in the next commit.
	• Purpose: The staging area allows you to selectively prepare files, creating a meaningful snapshot of the project in the next commit.
	• Usage: You use the git add command to place new or modified files into the staging area.

3. Local Repository
	• Definition: The local repository contains all commits made for the project, forming its version history.
	• Purpose: This is where Git stores all snapshots, enabling you to track the complete history of changes in the project.
	• The Local Repository is where Git stores all the commits and version history of your project on your computer. It’s located in a hidden .git folder within your project directory. This repository lets you track changes, create commits, and manage versions locally.

4. Project Directory
	• Definition: The project directory is the primary folder on your local computer that contains:
		○ Working Tree: The directory and files for a single commit or snapshot.
		○ Hidden .git Directory: Houses the staging area and local repository.
	• Usage:
		○ If you delete your project directory, you will also delete the local repository and staging area stored in .git.

5. Remote Repository
	• Definition: Located in a data center or the cloud, the remote repository serves as the official state or "source of truth" for the project.
	• Purpose: Contains all commits and enables sharing and synchronizing project states between local machines.
	• Usage: When synchronized, the remote and local repositories contain the same commits.

Summary
	• Working Tree: Project files for a single commit; editable files.
	• Staging Area: Lists files for inclusion in the next commit.
	• Local Repository: Stores the complete history of commits.
	• Project Directory: Contains the working tree and the hidden .git directory (with staging area and local repository).
	• Remote Repository: The project's official state on a remote server.
Understanding these Git locations helps you navigate and manage your project history effectively. As you advance, these concepts will become second nature!



Creating a Local Git Repository Using the Command Line
In this section, we'll go through the steps to create a new local Git repository using the command line. This process will automatically set up the working tree and staging area as part of the new repository.


Before running git init, you need to navigate to the path of the directory you want to initialize as a Git repository. You can do this by using the cd (change directory) command in your terminal.
Here's the typical workflow:
	1. Navigate to the directory you want to turn into a Git repository:

  cd path/to/your/directory

Run git init to initialize an empty Git repository in that directory:

git init

What git init Does
	1. Local Repository Creation
Running git init initializes a new Git repository in the directory by creating a hidden .git folder. This folder acts as the heart of the repository, storing everything needed for Git to track and manage files in this directory.
	2. Commit History Storage
Every commit you make after initializing the repository is saved within the .git folder. Git stores all changes made to files, the commit history, and the repository state at each commit point. This structure enables you to review and revert to previous commits.
	3. File Tracking and Versioning
Once initialized, Git can track changes in files. Every time you commit, Git takes a "snapshot" of the files, capturing their current state. These snapshots (commits) allow you to revisit any specific version, providing a complete history of file changes.
Summary
Using git init sets up a local repository that stores every version of tracked files in the .git folder, enabling powerful version control right from your local machine. This is what makes Git such a strong tool for managing file history and collaboration!



Committing to a Local Repository Using Command Line
Overview
In this video, you will learn how to commit changes to a local Git repository using the command line. The process involves checking the status of files, staging changes, committing those changes, and viewing the commit history.
1. Viewing File Status
	• Use the command git status to view the status of files in the working tree and staging area.
		○ The first line indicates the current branch (usually master).
		○ The second line shows whether there are any new or modified files.
	• Important Note: If no changes have been made since the last commit, you will not be able to create a new commit.
2. Adding Files to the Working Tree
	• Add a new file named fileA.txt to the working tree.
		○ Initially, Git marks it as untracked.
		○ Git suggests using git add to add the file to the staging area.
3. Staging Changes
	• Use git add to stage content for the next commit.
		○ Example: git add fileA.txt stages the file.
		○ After staging, git status shows that there are changes ready to be committed.
	• Adding Directories:
		○ You can add a whole directory using git add dirA/, which stages all files within that directory.
Using git add .
	• Use git add . to stage all untracked or modified files in the current directory.
		○ Caution: This command may stage files you didn't intend to commit.
4. Understanding Modified Files
	• A modified file is one that has been changed after it was last staged or committed.
	• Example Workflow:
		1. Create fileA.txt and stage it.
		2. Modify fileA.txt again, resulting in two states:
			§ Staged version (represented by a green A).
			§ Modified version (represented by a red M).
		3. Stage the modified version again to update the commit.
5. Committing Changes
	• Use git commit to add staged content to the local repository.
		○ Include a message using the -m flag.
			§ Example: git commit -m "Initial commit"
	• If you do not use -m, the default Git editor opens for entering a detailed message.
6. Viewing Commit History
	• Use git log to view the commit history in your local repository.
		○ Shows all commits along with their messages.
	• Use the --oneline flag for a condensed view of the commit history.
		○ Example: git log --oneline
	• You can also specify the number of recent commits to display.
		○ Example: git log -n 2 shows the two most recent commits.
Summary of Commands
	• git status: View the status of files in the working tree and staging area.
	• git add: Stage untracked or modified files for the next commit.
	• git commit: Create a snapshot of the current project and store it in the local repository.
	• git log: View the commit history of the repository.
