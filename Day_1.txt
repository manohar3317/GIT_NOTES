Introduction 
In this video, we will discuss the relationship between DevOps and Git. If you're unfamiliar with DevOps, it involves modern software development practices. If you're also new to the Git version control system, you're in the right place, as this course focuses on Git. 
 
 
Continuous Improvement in DevOps 
 
Key Principles of DevOps 
• Continuous Planning, Building, and Releasing: DevOps emphasizes continuously adding small improvements to a product, contrasting with the waterfall approach, where many features are planned, developed, and released as a single batch. 
• Small Batch Sizes: Continuous improvement involves making incremental changes to a product, often referred to as small batch sizes. 
Example of Continuous Improvement 
• Bug Fixes: On the left, a product with a bug; on the right, the bug has been removed. Each small change represents a new version of the product. 
• Feature Additions: One version of a product contains only blue icons, while the next version adds the feature of multicolor icons. 
 
 
How Git Supports Continuous Improvement 
Managing Project Versions with Commits 
Git manages the history of a project by tracking versions, called commits. Each commit is a snapshot of the project at a particular moment in time. 
• Commit A and B Example: 
• Commit A: Initial version with a bug. 
• Commit B: Version with the bug fixed, only one file changed out of 50. 
• Git tracks only unique changes instead of duplicating all files, making it very efficient. 
• The new commit appears to contain the whole file with 52 lines, but Git actually stores only the 2-line change and references the existing data, making it efficient. 
Efficient Storage in Git 
Git does not duplicate files in each commit: 
• Unique Files Only: Git stores each unique file only once. 
• Commit Example: After Commit A, Git stores 50 files. Commit B adds only one file with the bug fix, resulting in 51 total files stored. 
Reviewing and Undoing Changes 
Git enables you to review a project’s history and undo changes by: 
• Reverting to Previous Versions: You can return to a previous version if a change is problematic or undesired. 
• Example: If a feature like multicolor icons (Commit B) is disliked, you can revert to the previous version (Commit A). 
 
 
Branches in Git 
Purpose of Branches 
A branch is an independent line of development within the project: 
• Master Branch: The default branch, often used for stable versions. 
• Feature Branches: Separate branches (e.g., featureX) allow for independent development without affecting the main project. 
Example of Branch Usage 
A featureX branch might include additional commits: 
• Master Branch: Represents stable project commits. 
• FeatureX Branch: Contains independent commits unique to that feature, separate from the master branch. 
Scaling Development with Branches 
Branches allow multiple teams to work on the project simultaneously: 
• Production Stability: The master branch can represent the production-ready version. 
• Feature and Bug Branches: Separate branches (e.g., featureX, bugY) allow for individual feature and bug development without impacting the main branch. 
 
 
Merging Branches and Pull Requests 
Merging Independent Branches 
Once a branch is ready, it can be merged into the main branch: 
• Merge Process: Combines changes from a feature branch (e.g., featureX) into the master branch, incorporating updates. 
Pull Requests for Quality Assurance 
A pull request is a request to merge one branch into another, facilitating: 
• Code Review and Discussion: Team members can review and discuss the proposed changes. 
• Automated Testing: Ensures no new issues are introduced by requiring that automated tests pass before merging. 
• Pull request not only merges the independent branch into the main branch but also automatically notifies the team to review and test the changes. This process ensures that new code is thoroughly checked before it becomes part of the main project. 
After acceptance, the branch is merged, and its content becomes the latest commit in the master branch, contributing to the overall project quality. 
 
 
Summary 
Git plays a fundamental role in DevOps and modern software development by: 
1. Managing small, continuous improvements to the project with commits. 
2. Allowing simultaneous stability and development through branches. 
3. Improving product quality via pull requests that include review and testing before merging.
